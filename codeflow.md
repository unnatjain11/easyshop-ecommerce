# Codeflow for EasyShop E-Commerce WebApp

## 1. User Entry and Navigation
- When a user visits the EasyShop website, the Next.js server renders the homepage, displaying featured products and categories.
- Navigation is handled via client-side routing (React/Next.js), allowing users to browse products, view product details, and access the cart or account pages without full page reloads.

## 2. Product Browsing and Search
- The frontend fetches product data from the backend API (Next.js API routes), which queries the Neon (Postgres) database for product listings, images, and details.
- Users can filter, search, and sort products. The UI updates dynamically using React state and context.
- Product images are served from the public directory and referenced in the database.

## 3. Cart Management
- Users can add products to their cart from product or detail pages. Cart state is managed globally using React Context.
- The cart persists across navigation and can be accessed from any page.
- Users can update quantities, remove items, or clear the cart. All changes are reflected in real-time in the UI.

## 4. Checkout Process
- On the checkout page, users enter billing and (optionally) shipping information. Forms are managed with React Hook Form and validated with Zod.
- The order summary is displayed, showing all cart items, quantities, and the total price.
- The user selects UPI/QR code as the payment method. A QR code is generated using the react-qr-code library, encoding the UPI payment string.
- The user scans the QR code with a UPI app and completes the payment externally.

## 5. Order Processing
- After payment, the user confirms the transaction in the app. The frontend sends the order data to the backend API.
- The backend validates the order, stores it in the database, and triggers an email confirmation using Nodemailer.
- Order details are saved in sessionStorage for display on the success page.
- The cart is cleared, and the user is redirected to an order success page with a summary and confirmation.

## 6. User Authentication (if enabled)
- Users can optionally sign up or log in. Authentication is handled via secure password hashing (bcryptjs) and session cookies.
- Authenticated users can view their order history, manage addresses, and update account details.

## 7. Admin and Maintenance Flows
- Admin users (if implemented) can access management pages to add/edit products, view orders, and manage inventory.
- Database schema and seed scripts (schema.sql, seed.sql) are used to initialize and populate the database.
- Maintenance scripts (setup-db.js) automate database setup and migrations.

## 8. Integrations and Utilities
- Email notifications are sent for order confirmations and support using Nodemailer.
- Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) track user behavior and sales.
- Error monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry) capture and report runtime issues.

## 9. Deployment and Hosting
- The app is deployed on Vercel, which handles CI/CD, hosting, and environment variable management.
- Environment variables are used for sensitive data (database URLs, email credentials, UPI IDs).

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- The codebase is maintained with regular updates, dependency management, and security patches.
- User feedback and analytics inform new features and optimizations.
